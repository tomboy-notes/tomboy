 <title>Configure and Setup Sync</title>

 <section id="enablesync">

	<title>Enable Sync</title>
	
	<p><app>Tomboy</app> can synchronize your notes between multiple
	computers.  This allows you to have a backup of your notes on another
	computer or to share your notes between computers so you always have 
	access to your notes.
	</p>
	
	<p>You can enable sync by opening <gui>Tomboy Preferences</gui> by 
	using your mouse to right click on the Tomboy icon in your panel,
	taskbar or dock and choose <gui>Preferences</gui> and then select
	the <gui>Synchronization</gui> tab.  You can also open <gui> Tomboy
	Preferences</gui> from the <gui>Search All Notes</gui> dialog. From
	the menu choose <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Preferences</gui>
	</guiseq>.
	</p>

 <section id="conflict">

	<title>Managing Note Conflict</title>
	
	<p>You can set the default behavior for Tomboy when
	a note is discovered to be a conflict.  This can occur
	when notes are not synced on a regular basis.
	</p>
	
	<p>In the <gui>Preferences</gui> dialog press the <gui>Advanced</gui>
	button.  You can select from three choices as the default behavior
	in managing conflicts:
	</p>
	
	<list>
		<item><p><gui>Always ask me what to do.</gui> This is the default
		choice and when Tomboy encounters a conflict Tomboy will
		always prompt you to ask you if you want to rename the local 
		note or replace your local note with the note the server has 
		stored.</p></item>
		<item><p><gui>Rename my local note.</gui>  If this option is 
		selected, Tomboy will automatically replace the note with a 
		copy from the remote computer and rename the note on your
		computer so you don't lose your information in your note.</p>
		</item>
		
		<item><p><gui>Replace my local note with the server's update.
		</gui>.  If you have selected this option, when you sync 
		Tomboy will overwrite and replace your note stored on your
		computer with a copy from the remote computer.</p>
		
		<note style="warning">
		<p>Automatically overwriting the note is permanent.  Your
		local note will be replaced by the copy on the remote
		computer and you will lose your information that was
		stored prior to syncing.</p>
		</note>
                </item>
		
	</list>

	<title>Configure Sync using WebDav</title>
	
	<p>In order to synchronize your notes with a WebDAV server, you will 
	need the wdfs FUSE file system installed.  Follow the documentation for
	 your operating system to set up FUSE for your user.  You will also 
	 need the GNOME Keyring installed.
	</p>
	
	<p>Choose <gui>WebDAV</gui> from the <gui>Service</gui>
 	drop-down list. Fill in the connection information for your server, and
 	then select the <gui>Save</gui> button.  
 	You are now ready to synchronize your notes.</p>

  <section id="ssh">

	<title>Configure Sync using SSH</title>
	
	<p>In order to synchronize your notes with an SSH server, you will need
      	the FUSE file system, also called <app>sshfs</app> installed.  Follow the
      	documentation for your operating system to set up FUSE for your user.  
      	You will also need an SSH key for your SSH server account that can be
	provided by the <app>GNOME Seahorse</app> application, which is also known as 
      	<app>Passwords and Encryption Keys</app>.
	</p>
	
	<p>It is recommended to use a third computer or server as the remote 
	computer to store the synchronized notes that are to be synced between 
	multiple computers.</p>

	<p>Open <app>Passwords and Encryption Keys</app> by choosing 
	<guiseq><gui>Applications</gui><gui>Accessories</gui>
	<gui>Passwords and Encryption Keys</gui></guiseq>.  
	Click on your key, and from the menu choose <guiseq><gui>Remote</gui>
	<gui>Configure Key for Secure Shell</gui></guiseq>  
	and enter the domain name or IP address of the computer you want to 
	sync to in <gui>Computer Name</gui>.  Enter the username of the 
	remote computer in <gui>Login Name:</gui> and press <gui>Set Up</gui>. 
	When prompted, enter the password and setting up your key will 
	be completed.
	</p>
	
	<p>In Tomboy, choose <gui>SSH</gui> from the <gui>Service</gui>
	drop-down list. Fill in the connection information for your server, 
	and select the <gui>Save</gui> button.  The <gui>Folder Path</gui>, 
	while optional, should point at an empty folder. You are now ready to 
	synchronize your notes.</p>

 </section>

 <section id="local">

	<title>Configure Sync to a local folder</title>
	
	<p>You may want to synchronize your notes to a local folder if that 
	folder is available to your other systems, or if that folder represents 
	a local mount of a remote server.
	</p>

	<p>Choose Local Folder from the <gui>Service</gui>
	drop-down list. Choose the desired synchronization 
	<gui>Folder Path</gui> and then click the <gui>Save</gui> button.  
	You are now ready to synchronize your notes.</p>
