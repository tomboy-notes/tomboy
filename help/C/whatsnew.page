  <title>What's New in <app>Tomboy</app></title>

  <p>
    <app>Tomboy</app> features a number of new improvements.  Tomboy should start noticeably
	faster thanks to improvements made in Tomboy's start-up time.
  </p>
  <p>
	Copying and pasting from Tomboy to other applications has been improved to support
	 formatting into other applications that can understand HTML, such as Evolution, OpenOffice.org
	and other applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    <app>Tomboy</app> can now synchronize your notes automatically for you when you
	when you have sync enabled.
  </p>

  <p>Support for Microsoft Windows 7 jump lists have been added helping you access your notes,
	search or create a new note faster directly from the Windows taskbar.
