Tomboy is a desktop note-taking application for Linux, Unix and Windows.
Simple and easy to use, but with potential to help you *organize* the ideas
and information you deal with every day.

Have you ever felt the frustration at not being able to locate a website you
wanted to check out, or find an email you found interesting, or remember an
idea about the direction of the political landscape in post-industrial
Australia? Or are you one of those desperate souls with home-made, buggy, or
not-quite-perfect notes systems ?

Time for **Tomboy**. We bet you'll be surprised at how well a little application
can make life less cluttered and run more smoothly.

**Tomboy** is easy to use but you can get more details about Tomboy's features and how to use it [here](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Tomboy).
